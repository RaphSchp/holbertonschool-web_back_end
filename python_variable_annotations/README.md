## Description

This is a novice-level web development project where you'll learn to use Advanced Python concepts, specifically Type Annotations in Python 3. Gain expertise in specifying function signatures and variable types, understand Duck typing, and validate code using MyPy. Follow coding standards, use allowed editors, and provide thorough documentation. Progress will be evaluated based on understanding without external help and adherence to coding guidelines., it was made in the software development program of [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.fr/).

# Learning Objectives

## General

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to <a href="https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/">explain to anyone</a>, **without the help of Google:**

* Type annotations in Python 3
* How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
* Duck typing
* How to validate your code with mypy

# Requirements

## General

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.9)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
* All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining what‚Äôs the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
