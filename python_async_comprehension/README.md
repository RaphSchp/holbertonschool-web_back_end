## Description

This is a novice-level web development project that delves into advanced Python concepts, focusing on Type Annotations in Python 3. Emphasizing adherence to coding standards, the project covers async programming, asyncio, concurrent coroutines, and the use of the random module. Created by Emmanuel Turlay, a Staff Software Engineer at Cruise, the project includes learning resources, objectives, and progress tracking through a project badge, it was made in the software development program of [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.fr/).

# Learning Objectives

## General

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to <a href="https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/">explain to anyone</a>, **without the help of Google:**

* How to write an asynchronous generator
* How to use async comprehensions
* How to type-annotate generators

# Requirements

## General

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.9)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
* All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining what‚Äôs the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
